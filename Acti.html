											General officers in modern society work in sedentary for a long time. In this context, death rates increase because of cardio disease
											or metabolic syndrome - a cluster of conditions that includes increased blood pressure, high blood sugar and so on. On the other hand,
											<i><b>‘Acti’</b></i> provides several functions changing user’s behavior to be more active such as standing desk, light and movable design.
											Consequently, officers will experience working health and be productive with using <i><b>‘Acti'</b></i>.

											<i><b>‘Acti’</b></i> changes sedentary culture in the office to be active(standing more, live longer). The product provides
											various functions; boards, desk and chair. With the mobility of the product, office workers can personalize
											their own space such as the combination of <i><b>‘Acti’</b></i> for burning time.

										<p>
											nowadays, workplace makes us to sit much more than we move around. However, it is fatal for health and affects productivity worse ironically.
											Even if people meet the recommended physical activity requirements, death rates are similar in exercisers and non-exercisers
											who spend most of their day sitting. In other world, <b>the more people stands, the longer people live.
											Exercise is useless if people do not stand frequently.</b>

											<h3 style="padding-bottom:1em">User Study</h3>
										</header>

										<a class="image featured"><img src="images/Acti/user_study_Acti_pic02.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											The purpose of user study is for answering the research questions below.
											Through this process, factors that promotes movement of sedentary workers can be found.
											User study is conducted to find out the specific dimension of sedentary culture across the office workers.
										</p>

										<p>
											<ul class="default">
												<li>In which situation do people move?</li>
												<li>In which situation do people not move?</li>
												<li>What do people usually do in sedentary?</li>
											</ul>
										</p>

										<p>
											Participants of user study are sedentary workers. One person is information guide who work in information desk of UNIST,
											two people are employee who work in UNIST CDE administration office and two people are start-up workers, Open Arena.
											Three groups are varying in their professions and demographics are recruited. Total 5 people are invited to the user study.
											All participants work in a sitting position dominantly.
										</p>

										<p style="color: #2CDAE3; font-weight:500; font-size:120%; padding-top:30px;">Video Ethnography</p>
										<a class="image featured"><img src="images/Acti/user_study_Acti_pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											Video recording of workers were done for their whole working hours. Their actions within the environment were scrutinized.
											It is useful method to get unbiased raw data and understand unconscious activity.
											Furthermore, video ethnography is suitable for sedentary workers because their workplace is limited.
										</p>

										<a class="image featured"><img src="images/Acti/user_study_Acti_pic04.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											Every moving activity, even it is trivial, is written on the <b>code book</b>. The time, duration, trigger and insight are written and analyzed.
										</p>

										<p style="color: #2CDAE3; font-weight:500; font-size:120%; padding-top:30px;">In-depth Interview</p>
										<a class="image featured"><img src="images/Acti/user_study_Acti_pic05.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											After analyzing video ethnography through the codebook, interview script is made for each groups.
											Their rationale behind their action was further inquired by interviewing.
											Same participants in video ethnography did in depth interview about 30 minutes.
											It is useful method to get information that can not know from the video ethnography.

											<h3>Analysis</h3>
										</header>

										<p style="color: #2CDAE3; font-weight:500; font-size:120%; padding-top:30px;">Frequency investigation</p>
										<a class="image featured"><img src="images/Acti/analysis_Acti_pic01.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											With recorded video, the number of standings and stretches is counted. Furthermore, the total time they stand up is also taken.
											Among three grounps, start-up owners are the people who stand up for the shortest time.
										</p>

										<p style="color: #2CDAE3; font-weight:500; font-size:120%; padding-top:30px;">Spatial Model of Sedentary Workplace</p>
										<a class="image featured"><img src="images/Acti/analysis_Acti_pic02.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											We create a spatial model to find the elements that make the sedentary workers move in the office environment.
											This model makes it possible to see at a glance the environment they are in.
										</p>

										<p style="color: #2CDAE3; font-weight:500; font-size:120%; padding-top:30px;">Affinity Diagram</p>
										<a class="image featured"><img src="images/Acti/analysis_Acti_pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											Small descriptions or insight obtained from the user study and above two methods are written on the post-it,
											then the affinity diagram is made to organize ideas and data. The situation in which people move or not move is divided into three subcategories,
											physical, social and environmental. As a result, four design criteria are created.

											<ul class="default">
												<b class="contact">Design Criteria</b>
												<li>break optimized sedentary environment</li>
												<li>Design of workstation</li>
												<li>increase movement through social interaction</li>
												<li>Make workers stand more frequently</li>
											</ul>
										</p>

											<h3>Concept</h3>
										</header>

										<p style="color: #2CDAE3; font-weight:500; font-size:120%; padding-top:30px;">Mental Model</p>
										<a class="image featured"><img src="images/Acti/concept_Acti_pic01.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											Throughout looking back research findings from the video ethnography, the optimized sedentary environment such as traditional desk seems
											the most critical reason why people tend to sit longer. Breaking optimized sedentary culture through re-design work station turns the point of the concept.
											It is the new concept that combining a desk and a partition which provide standing desk as a fundamental function and a little stool to get a rest.
										</p>

										<p style="color: #2CDAE3; font-weight:500; font-size:120%; padding-top:30px;">Use Scenario</p>
										<a class="image featured"><img src="images/Acti/concept_Acti_pic02.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											In order to engage and promote people to stand and move more frequently, mobility function is added finally.
											Through this finalized concept office worker is expected to use the product under defined user scenario which contains:
											<ul class="default">
												<class="contact">
												<li><b>Standing desk:</b> The product plays the role as a standing desk once the user folds down the plate on top of the moving partition.</li>
												<li><b>Mobility:</b> Through the movable functions and the light design, users can easility have a tendency to stand and move more frequently.</li>
												<li><b>Spatial design:</b> Users can use the products to make their own layout freely. For example, a couple of people can place three products as a triangle then it becomes a space for meeting enough even if it is not completely isolated.</li>
											</ul>
										</p>

										<p style="color: #2CDAE3; font-weight:500; font-size:120%; padding-top:30px;">Proposals</p>
										<a class="image featured"><img src="images/Acti/concept_Acti_pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											According to the use scenario design, the product’s main features were determined; mobile partition, standing desk and chair.
											Then three suggestions have been proposed through ideation process.

											<h3>User Evaluation</h3>
										</header>

										<p style="color: #2CDAE3; font-weight:500; font-size:120%; padding-top:30px;">Prototype</p>
										<a class="image featured"><img src="images/Acti/user_evaluation_Acti_pic01.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											The final working prototype is made linear aluminum rod and thick box paper.
											The aluminum frame is used for making the product frame, which holds the body, and stand needed to hold the wheels.
											The thick box paper is used for the main body which is transformable as desk, chair and partition.
											To hold the paper as 90 degrees, steel wire is fixed at the hinge part of the paper.
											Thanks to the hole of aluminum rod, the body part can be moved upward and downward, which is the required function for ergonomic issue.
										</p>

										<p style="color: #2CDAE3; font-weight:500; font-size:120%; padding-top:30px;">Participants</p>
										<a class="image featured"><img src="images/Acti/user_evaluation_Acti_pic02.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											The target groups are start up workers who have work experience in their start – up over 1 year.
											They are targeted because they are the group who stand up for the shortest time at user study stage.
											Total two groups are recruited. One group is composed as two people who work in the same start up.
											User Evaluation should be conducted as group because of utilization of space.
											For adapting ‘acti’ to various situation discussion of co-workers is really important.
										</p>

										<p style="color: #2CDAE3; font-weight:500; font-size:120%; padding-top:30px;">User Evaluation</p>
										<a class="image featured"><img src="images/Acti/user_evaluation_Acti_pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											With prototyping test, each group is asked to use ‘acti’ freely without any descriptions.
											They all answered to the question ‘what kind of product is mignt be?’.
											It is for experimenting how they feel and accept this new concept of product?
											Then all functions are informed and they are recommended to use every function.

										<a class="image featured"><img src="images/Acti/redesign_Acti_pic01.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
										 After executing user evaluation, redesign is processed. It is need to contain various functions such as desk, chair and boards
										 for spatial efficiency. In addition, the office furniture should help communication between team members.
										 Through sketch, our final design outcome is drawn.
										</p>

										<p style="color: #2CDAE3; font-weight:500; font-size:120%; padding-top:30px;">Final Design</p>
										<a class="image featured"><img src="images/Acti/redesign_Acti_pic02.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											This is rendering image of final design. It is designed to give a bright and active overall look.
											Office workers can use it as desk, chair or blackboards as preferred.
											In addition, they can freely configure the office space by moving the furniture.
